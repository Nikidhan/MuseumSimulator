Concurrency Programming Assignment

We could not upload the JAR file here since Github have limit the size of the uploaded file to 25MB only but the JAR was 80+MB.
Therefore we upload it here in Google Drive: https://bit.ly/3zv8e9r

To open the Museum Simulator JAR, we have to run this command in the terminal:

java --module-path <JavaFX 11.0.2 lib file path> --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics,javafx.web -jar Assignment.jar

Replace <JavaFX 11.0.2 lib file path> with your JavaFX library file path. The version that we are using is JavaFX SDK 11.0.2.
Inside the download link, we have include the .bat file that contains the command above. Please amend the .bat using your text editor to change the JavaFX lib file path.
